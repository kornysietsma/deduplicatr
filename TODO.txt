TODO:
- ignore symlinks - either needs java 7, or JNI, or slow ugly hacks!
-- or could post-process and remove symlinks from duplicates not from trees
-- at minimum, suggest ways to combine with "find -type l" (for which we need to be able to ignore a list of paths!) - this is the simplest option
- sort by number of files instead of just size
- add logging, especially progress on slow jobs, file counts
- add ignore patterns e.g. hidden files, .git / .svn  / .cvs etc - needs to be configurable
- use config files for common config patterns like ignores
longer term:
- cache tree data in file or db, allow for rapid re-scanning, comparing to non-mounted media.
- look for superset/subset; if we meet 2 directories with a lot of dups, clump the dups together
  and/or show differences not dups.  i.e. "/foo and /bar match except for..."
- build a web/JS ui for interactivity - probably easier, ultimately, than dreaming up command line ui.
- consider adding disk space usage display - handy if cleaning up is the goal
- add ability to delete things!  Carefully, probably with mandatory "move to trash" or similar.
- hunt down previous incarnations of this, see if there were good ideas in those!

Done:
- handle multiple sources
- filter file prefixes in output (especially now we have group names)
