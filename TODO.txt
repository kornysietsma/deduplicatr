TODO:
- filter out parent/child exact matches, only show the child (probably most meaningful)
-  needs to cope with grandparents as well, so foo, foo/bar and foo/bar/baz might be the same but contain multiple files in baz...
- handle very large file lists - currently stack overflows pretty fast
- lots of other stuff
