TODO:
- use "a", "b" not :a :b in diff mode, for nicer output
- ? scan directory first so we can log %complete
- ? consider more unit tests for diffs.clj
- use config files for common config patterns like ignores
- fix documentation on github, put uberjar somewhere for others to download
longer term:
- cache tree data in file or db, allow for rapid re-scanning, comparing to non-mounted media.
- look for superset/subset; if we meet 2 directories with a lot of dups, clump the dups together
- build a web/JS ui for interactivity - probably easier, ultimately, than dreaming up command line ui.
- consider adding disk space usage display - handy if cleaning up is the goal
- add ability to delete things!  Carefully, probably with mandatory "move to trash" or similar.
- hunt down previous incarnations of this, see if there were good ideas in those!

Done:
- handle multiple sources
- filter file prefixes in output (especially now we have group names) 
- ignores symlinks!
- add logging, especially progress on slow jobs
- log file counts / bytes instead of / as well as names
- catch exceptions! (my NAS sometimes screws up)
- test progress-logger
- don't show a/foo and b/bar as matching if a and b match
- sort files/dirs so progress is clearer for big scans  
- add ignore patterns e.g. hidden files, .git / .svn  / .cvs etc - needs to be configurable
- default to at least .DS_Store !!
- add a 'diff' command for examining similar dirs once duplicates found
- allow sorting by number of files instead of just size
