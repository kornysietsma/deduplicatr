TODO:
- ignore symlinks - either needs java 7, or JNI, or slow ugly hacks!
-- or could post-process and remove symlinks from duplicates not from trees
- add logging, especially progress on slow jobs, file counts
- add ignore patterns? e.g. hidden files, .git / .svn  / .cvs etc - needs to be configurable

longer term:
- publish uberjar somewhere for non-clojure users
- interactive operation for exploring changes
- cache tree data in file or db, allow for rapid re-scanning, comparing to non-mounted media.
- look for superset/subset; if we meet 2 directories with a lot of dups, clump the dups together
  and/or show differences not dups.  i.e. "/foo and /bar match except for..."
 - hunt down previous incarnations of this, see if there were good ideas in those!
