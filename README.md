# deduplicatr

A Clojure application designed to find duplicates in a large set of files

This is a work in progress - it is currently working, but very much in a beta state.

Note that as of the latest update, you need Java 7 to build and run this, as it uses new language features - most significantly, the ability to ignore symlinks!

## Usage

Currently this needs Java 7, and leningen 2.0+ to run - you can use "lein uberjar" to produce a standalone runnable jar, for running without clojure/leiningen.

Usage at this stage is fairly simple:

$ lein run [directories]

$ java -jar deduplicatr.jar [directories]

This will scan all files in the directory, then print out all duplicate directories / files, largest first.  Pipe the results through "less" or similar if you get a lot of output

For help/options you need to specify '--' to skip leiningen option processing:

$ lein run -- -h

$ java -jar deduplicatr.jar -h

You can ignore files and directories with "-i" and a comma-separated list of names - note this is only exact names at this stage (and you can't ignore a name with a comma in it!).  By default the MacOS metadata file ".DS_Store" is ignored, but you can specify your own list:

$ lein run -- -i ".git,.svn,.DS_Store" foo/bar

$ java -jar deduplicatr.jar -i ".git,.svn,.DS_Store" foo/bar

## Documentation
Introductory documentation is in [the wiki on github](https://github.com/kornysietsma/deduplicatr/wiki).
Finally the [tests](https://github.com/kornysietsma/deduplicatr/tree/master/test/deduplicatr) are also a great way to understand what is going on - this project is mostly test-driven.

## Thanks
Lots of thanks to Hank at the Melbourne clojure group for prompting some radical refactorings
