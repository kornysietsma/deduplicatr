# deduplicatr

A Clojure application designed to find duplicates in a large set of files

Note that as of the latest update, you need Java 7 to build and run this, as it uses new language features - most significantly, the ability to ignore symlinks!

## Usage

Currently this needs Java 7, and leningen 2.0+ to run - you can use "lein uberjar" to produce a standalone runnable jar, for running without clojure/leiningen.

Generally it's fastest to generate an uberjar and then run the commands with:

$ java -jar deduplicatr.jar [parameters]

In dev mode you can use "lein run" to run it while playing with changes; the command is then

$ lein run [parameters]

If you want to pass extra options you need a "--" to tell leiningen to pass commands to the app:

$ lein run -- [parameters]

Usage at this stage is fairly simple:

### Standard mode - duplicate finding

$ java -jar deduplicatr.jar [directories]

This will scan all files in the directory, then print out all duplicate directories / files, largest first.  Pipe the results through "less" or similar if you get a lot of output.

So for example if you point this at three big directories "foo", "bar" and "baz", you might get output like:

```
duplicates:
2 matches of 4,125,793,965 bytes
   a: 2008_ebooks/gutenberg/ (13645 files)
   b: 2009_ebooks_sorting/old_ebooks/gutenberg/ (13645 files)
2 matches of 14,117,470 bytes
   b: calibre/Michael Fogus_ Chris Houser/The Joy of Clojure (1607)/The Joy of Clojure - Michael Fogus_ Chris Houser.pdf
   c: tech/manning/clojure/TheJoyofClojure.pdf
```

This indicates that "foo/" and "bar/" both have a project gutenberg dump from old backups, and that "bar/" and "baz/" both have a copy of the Joy of Clojure (a great book!)

For more help run:

$ java -jar deduplicatr.jar -h

You can ignore files and directories with "-i" and a comma-separated list of names - note this is only exact names at this stage (and you can't ignore a name with a comma in it!).  By default the MacOS metadata file ".DS_Store" is ignored, but you can specify your own list:

$ java -jar deduplicatr.jar -i ".git,.svn,.DS_Store" foo/bar

### Diff mode - finding differences between two directories

$ java -jar deduplicatr.jar --diff [directory a] [directory b]

This will scan two similar directories, and output:

- all dirs/files in both directories
- all dirs/files only in directory "a"
- all dirs/files only in directory "b"

Note these lists are pruned so only the topmost relevant directory is reported.
So given the following structures:

```
dir_a/
  in_a/
    a.txt
  in_both/
    foo.txt

dir_b/
  in_b/
    b.txt
  in_both/
    foo.txt
```

The output will be something like:

```
in both:
  a: in_both
  b: in_both
in dir_a:
  a: in_a
in dir_b:
  b: in_b
```

and the individual files "a.txt", "foo.txt" etc. are not listed.

## Documentation
Out of date documentation is in [the wiki on github](https://github.com/kornysietsma/deduplicatr/wiki) - this file is probably the best you'll get for now.
The [tests](https://github.com/kornysietsma/deduplicatr/tree/master/test/deduplicatr) are also a great way to understand what is going on - this project is mostly test-driven.

## Thanks
Lots of thanks to Hank at the Melbourne clojure group for prompting some radical refactorings
